This is a fork of rust-spdm. While we hope to upstream all changes, we are maintaining this fork for
2 reasons.

 1. We are under heavy developement in the control plane and will need to make rapid changes to keep
pace.
 2. We will need to make this code work for microcontrollers, which may involve removing the use of
ring.

When we have upstreamed all our changes we can delete our fork :)

We are maintaining our fork using the procedures layed out in RFD 211.
